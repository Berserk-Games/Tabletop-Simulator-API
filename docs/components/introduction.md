	Component APIs are an advanced feature. An **understanding of how Unity works is required** to utilize them.

A Component is a collection of functions and variables that allow you to control object behavior.

Components are a [Unity concept](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html), they're the building blocks that
Tabletop Simulator objects are composed of.

## GameObjects

Every object in Tabletop Simulator is a [GameObject](gameobject.md). When a game is created, GameObjects are loaded,
initialized and _some_ of these top-level GameObjects are then exposed via Tabletop Simulator's Lua scripting APIs
as regular [Objects](../object.md), each with their own scripting contexts.

Some Lua-exposed Objects are made-up of a hierarchy of children GameObjects. The Component APIs allow you to access and
interact with these children GameObjects (which you'd otherwise be unable to control).

## Components

GameObjects are themselves made up of [Components](component.md). A typical GameObject would contain a Collider,
Transform, Mesh etc. These Components describe the GameObject's behavior and visual representation.

!!!tip
    In addition to built-in Objects, the Component APIs provide access the GameObjects and Components that exist in
    AssetBundles. This means that when creating an AssetBundle, you may attach all manner of components (lights, sounds
    etc.) and you'll be able to control them via these APIs.

## Vars

Each Component has **Vars**. These are variables which you can modify to change how that Component affects the
GameObject it composes.

## Materials

GameObjects with Renderer components typically also have attached [Materials](material.md), which govern the appearance of the object.
