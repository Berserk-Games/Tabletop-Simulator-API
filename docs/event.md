Events are functions which are activated by Tabletop Simulator when something takes place in-game. It is possible to use all of them within scripts on Objects, and most will also work in Global scripts.

Many contain parameters which can be used to utilize additional information related to the event.

##Function Summary

##Function Details (Global & Object)

###filterObjectEnterContainer(...)

Called when an object attempts to enter a container. The object is prevented from entering unless "true" is returned.

!!!info "filterObjectEnter(container, enter_object)"

	* [<span class="tag obj"></span>](types.md)&nbsp;**enter_object**: The Object entering the container.

``` Lua
function filterObjectEnterContainer(container, enter_object)
	print(enter_object.getName()) -- Print entering object's name
	return true -- Allows object to enter.
end
```


---

###onChat(...)

This function is called when a message is sent through the in-game chat. It does not trigger when global chat messages are sent. Using `#!lua return false` inside of this function prevents the chat message which triggered it to be suppressed.

!!!info "onChat(message, sender)"
	* [<span class="tag str"></span>](types.md)&nbsp;**message**: Chat message which triggered the function.
	* [<span class="tag pla"></span>](types.md)&nbsp;**sender**: Player which sent the chat message.

``` Lua
function onChat(message, player)
	print(message)
	print(player.color)
end
```

---


###onExternalMessage(...)

This function is called when an external script editor (like [Atom](atom.md)) sends a message back to the game. Used for custom editor functionality.

!!!info "onExternalMessage(data)"
	* [<span class="tag tab"></span>](types.md)&nbsp;**data**: The data returned by the external editor into the game.

``` Lua
function onExternalMessage(data)
	print("External message received")
end
```

---


###onFixedUpdate()

Called **every physics tick** (90 times a second). This is a frame independent onUpdate().

!!!warning
	This is a very expensive function and can easily slow/crash your game if misused. Use with caution.

``` Lua
function onFixedUpdate()
	self.addTorque({0,100,0}, 1)
end
```


###onLoad(...)

This function is called when a game save is finished loading every Object. This is where most setup code will go. The fast-forward and rewind feature will also cause this function to activate. If this function is in an Object's script and that Object is spawned, like by removing it from a container, it too will trigger onLoad().

!!!info "onLoad(save_state)"
	* [<span class="tag str"></span>](types.md)&nbsp;**save_state**: The encoded string containing any save_state (saved) data.
		* {>>If there is no data saved, this returns an empty String.<<}

``` Lua
function onLoad()
	print("Loading complete")
end
```

???example "Example of onLoad and onSave being used to save/load data"
    ``` Lua
	-- Runs whenever game is saved/autosaved
	function onSave()
		local data_to_save = {someData=50}
		saved_data = JSON.encode(data_to_save)
		--saved_data = "" --Remove -- at start & save to clear save data
		return saved_data
	end

	-- Runs when game is loaded
	function onLoad(saved_data)
		-- Loads the tracking for if the game has started yet
		if saved_data ~= "" then
			local loaded_data = JSON.decode(saved_data)
			someData = loaded_data.someData
		else
			someData = 50
		end
	end
    ```

---


###onSave()

This is called whenever the game saves, either manually or by auto-save. This will work in both a Global script, and an Object script. It is used to allow information to persist through saving/loading, for example, to let your script remember its data previously after hitting the Undo or Redo button. By placing script information into a Lua table, then encoding that data into [JSON](#json), you are able to save information about the script's current state onto the script's parent, in the form of a string. You can also return a string value in this function to stash it.

!!!important
	When using `onSave()`, information is saved into the save file you are using. Using *Save & Apply* does NOT cause it to record data, only overwriting your save will update what information `onSave()` is trying to record.

!!!warning
	You can save almost any data in a table using this function, but Object references **DO NOT** persist. If you need to record an Object using `onSave()`, record its GUID instead.

``` Lua
data_table = {answer=42}

function onSave()
	saved_data = JSON.encode(data_table)
	return saved_data
end
```

Check the [`onLoad()`](#onload) section for how to load that stored JSON information into your script.

	* [<span class="tag str"></span>](types.md)&nbsp;**player_color**: [Player Color](player-color.md) of the player who triggered the function.

``` Lua
function onScriptingButtonDown(index, color)
	print(index)
end
```

---

###onScriptingButtonUp(...)

Called when a scripting button (numpad by default) is released. The index range that is returned is 1-10.

!!!info "onScriptingButtonUp(index, player_color)"
	* [<span class="tag int"></span>](types.md)&nbsp;**index**: Index number, representing which key was released.

		* [<span class="tag tab"></span>](types.md)&nbsp;**collision_info.*contact_points***: Table/array full of contact points, where each 3D point is represented by a (number indexed) table, _not_ a [Vector](vector.md).
