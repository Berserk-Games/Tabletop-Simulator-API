The Global Script is a script that lives in your game that can run background tasks and do general game management type functions. Object scripts are attached to an individual object. Objects are anything with a physical model in the game - chess piece, dice, decks, cards, bags, custom models, boards, etc. Both types of scripts can call the same functions, but Object scripts have access to a reference of the Object it is attached to with the self keyword.

We created an official plugin for the Atom text editor to make writing Lua scripts for Tabletop Simulator super easy and fun! This page provides a basic overview of how to install and use the plugin; if you would like a more in-depth explanation of its features and how to install/use it then please see its documentation: Atom Plugin Documentation Home Installation Instructions Features Commands Settings Our official plugin introduces syntax highlighting, code autocompletion for the Tabletop Simulator Lua API, and functions to interact with the game. The in-game editor will continue to exist for quick access to scripts, but development on it will cease to continue. Prefer another text editor? Take look at our External Editor API to make your own plugin. Features This is only a summarized list of features Atom offers. Check out a more complete documentation on the plugin specifically in the plugin wiki . Syntax Highlighting All standard Lua syntax is highlighted in multiple colors to help with readability. Code Autocompletion The entire Tabletop Simulator Lua Scripting API (with the exception of the Player class) has been added to the native Atom autocomplete system. Easily see all of the member variables and functions available to you with their parameters, return type, short description, and a link directly to our Knowledge Base with more information for that variable or function. Functions belonging to the Lua standard library classes such as math, coroutine, or os link directly to the official Lua documentation. Tabletop Simulator Interactivity The Atom plugin can directly connect to a running instance of Tabletop Simulator to get all of the existing Lua scripts on Objects and to call Save & Play. Both functions can be called directly from the Packages menu or the right click contextual menu. TTS must be running with the game loaded for these functions to work. Command Action Taken Get Lua Scripts Downloads all existing scripts in a loaded Tabletop Simulator game with Atom. You will need to call Get Lua Scripts every time you change to a different game in TTS. Save & Play Saves all Lua files in Atom, uploads them to a loaded Tabletop Simulator game, and reloads the current game (same as Save & Play in the in-game editor). Every time you start up Atom, the cached local *.lua files are deleted. Installing Atom Download and install Atom from the official website . Installing the Official Plugin Click on File -> Settings Select the Install tab in Settings Type in tabletopsimulator-lua into the search field and press the Enter key or click the Packages button Click the blue Install button for the tabletopsimulator-lua package Setting Up Atom Tab Width By default, Tabletop Simulator scripts use a tab width of four spaces. You are not required to adhere to this spacing. By default, Atom has a tab width of two spaces. To optionally make Atom default to a tab width of four spaces: Click on File -> Settings Select the Settings tab in Settings Scroll down to Tab Length Set the Tab Length to 4 Tables as Pipe Operators To enable tabs showing up as pipe operators \"|\" as an indent guide: Click on File -> Settings Select the Settings tab in Settings Scroll down to Show Indent Guide Check Show Indent Guide Updating Atom Plugin The plugin will automatically check for updates when Atom is started.

These functions can utilize in-game Objects, but none of them can be enacted on in-game Objects. They all deal with the game space. Function Summary Global Functions General functions which work within any script. Function Name Description Return copy( object_list) Copy a list of Objects to the clipboard. Works with paste(...) . destroyObject( obj) Destory an Object. flipTable() Flip the table. getAllObjects() Returns Table of all spawned Objects in the game. getObjectFromGUID( guid) Returns Object by its GUID.

Works with copy(...) . setLookingForPlayers( lfp) Enables/disables looking for group. This is visible in the server browsers, indicating if you are recruiting for a game. spawnObject( parameters) Spawns an Object. View the Spawnable Object page for Objects that can be spawned. spawnObjectJSON( parameters) Spawns an Object using a JSON string. Works with getJSON() . startLuaCoroutine( function_owner, function_name) Start a coroutine. stringColorToRGB( player_color) Converts a Player Color string into a Color Table for tinting. Message Functions Functions which handle sending and displaying data. Function Name Description Return broadcastToAll( message, message_tint) Print an on-screen message to all Players, as well as their in-game chat. broadcastToColor( message, player_color, message_tint) Print an on-screen message to a specified Player, as well as their in-game chat. log( element, label, tag) Print information to the log tab. (Shortcut: ~) logStyle( tag, tint, prefix, postfix) Set style options for the specified tag type for the log. print( message) Prints a string into chat that only the host is able to see. Used for debugging scripts. printToAll( message, message_tint) Print a message into the chat of all connected players. printToColor( message, player_color, message_tint) Print a message to a specific Player Color . sendExternalMessage( data) Send a table to your external script editor, most likely Atom. This is for custom editor functionality. Function Details Global Function details copy(...) Copying a list of Objects the clipboard. Works with paste(...) . copy(object_list) object_list : A Table of in-game objects to be copied. This is similar to highlighting the objects in-game and copying them. object_list = { getObjectFromGUID ( \"######\" ), getObjectFromGUID ( \"######\" ), } copy ( object_list ) destroyObject(...) Destroy an Object. destroyObject(obj) obj : The Object you wish to delete from the instance. getObjectFromGUID(...) Returns Object by its GUID. Will return nil if this GUID doesn't currently exist. getObjectFromGUID(guid) guid : GUID of the Object to get a reference of. GUID can be obtained by right clicking an object and going to Scripting. In a script, it can be obtained from any Object by using .getGUID(). group(...) Groups objects together, like how the G key does for players. It returns an object reference to the deck/stack formed. Not all objects CAN be grouped. If the G key won't work on them, neither will this function. group(objects) objects : A list of objects to be grouped together. function onLoad () local objList = { getObjectFromGUID ( \"b80a72\" ), getObjectFromGUID ( \"a333b4\" ), getObjectFromGUID ( \"c9f9d3\" ), } group ( objList ) end paste(...) Pastes Objects in-game that were copied to the in-game clipboard. Works with copy(...) . paste(parameters) parameters : A Table containing instructions of where to spawn the Objects. parameters.position : Position of the first object to paste. Optional, defaults to {0, 3, 0}. parameters.snap_to_grid : If snap-to-grid is active on the spawned item/s. Optional, defaults to false (off). spawnObject(...) Spawn an Object. View the Spawnable Objects page for Objects that can be spawned. If you are spawning a custom Object , you should call setCustomObject immediately after spawnObject to set its custom properties. Tip Spawned Objects take a moment to be physically spawned into the game. The purpose of the callback functionality is to allow you to run additional actions after the Object has been initiated fully into the instance. You can also add a delay after spawning using a Wait function. spawnObject(parameters) parameters : A Table of parameters used to determine how spawnObject will act. parameters.type : Spawnable Object type. parameters.position : Position to place Object. Optional, defaults to {x=0, y=3, z=0}. parameters.rotation : Rotation of the Object. Optional, defaults to {x=0, y=0, z=0} parameters.scale : Scale of the Object. Optional, defaults to {x=1, y=1, z=1} parameters.sound : If the spawned Object noise is played. Optional, defaults to true. parameters.snap_to_grid : If snap-to-grid is active on the Object. Optional, defaults to false. parameters.callback_function : The function to activate after the Object has finished spawning into the scene. Optional, defaults to not being used. A reference to the object spawned is always passed to callback_function. See the example for how to access it. function onLoad () futureName = \"Spawned By Script!\" spawnParams = { type = \"rpg_BEAR\" , position = { x = 0 , y = 3 , z =- 5 }, rotation = { x = 0 , y = 90 , z = 0 }, scale = { x = 2 , y = 2 , z = 2 }, sound = false , snap_to_grid = true , callback_function = function ( obj ) spawn_callback ( obj , \"Bear\" , \"Green\" ) end } spawnObject ( spawnParams ) end function spawn_callback ( object_spawned , name , color ) object_spawned . setName ( name ) object_spawned . setColorTint ( color ) end spawnObjectJSON(...) Spawns an Object using a JSON string. Works with getJSON() . It works just like spawnObject, but instead of a type , you supply a json string. The other parameters will overwrite those in the JSON. Tip Spawned Objects take a moment to be physically spawned into the game. The purpose of the callback functionality is to allow you to run additional actions after the Object has been initiated fully into the instance. You can also add a delay after spawning using a Wait function. spawnObjectJSON(parameters) parameters : A Table of parameters used to determine how spawnObjectJSON will act. parameters.json : getJSON() string. parameters.position : Position to place Object. Optional, defaults to JSON's value. parameters.rotation : Rotation of the Object. Optional, defaults to JSON's value. parameters.scale : Scale of the Object. Optional, defaults to JSON's value. parameters.sound : If the spawned Object noise is played. Optional, defaults to JSON's value. parameters.snap_to_grid : If snap-to-grid is active on the Object.

Start a coroutine. A coroutine is similar to a function, but has the unique ability to have its run paused until the next frame of the game using coroutine.yield(0) . Attention You MUST return a 1 at the end of any coroutine or it will throw an error. startLuaCoroutine(function_owner, function_name) function_owner : The Object that the function being called is on. Global is a valid target. function_name : Name of the function being called as a coroutine. function onLoad () startLuaCoroutine ( Global , \"print_coroutine\" ) end -- Prints a message, waits 250 frames, prints another message function print_coroutine () print ( \"Routine has Started\" ) count = 0 while count < 250 do count = count + 1 coroutine.yield ( 0 ) end print ( \"Routine has Finished\" ) return 1 end stringColorToRGB(...) Converts a Player Color string into a Color Table for tinting. stringColorToRGB(player_color) player_color A String of a Player Color . printToAll ( \"Blue message\" , stringColorToRGB ( \"Blue\" )) Message Function Details broadcastToAll(...) Print an on-screen message to all Players. broadcastToAll(message, message_tint) message : Message to display on-screen. message_tint : A Table containing the RGB color tint for the text. msg = \"Hello all.\" rgb = { r = 1 , g = 0 , b = 0 } broadcastToAll ( msg , rgb ) broadcastToColor(...) Print an on-screen message to a specified Player and their in-game chat. broadcastToColor(message, player_color , message_tint) message : Message to display on-screen. player_color : Player Color to receive the message. message_tint : RGB color tint for the text. msg = \"Hello White.\" color = \"White\" rgb = { r = 1 , g = 0 , b = 0 } broadcastToColor ( msg , color , rgb ) log(...) Print information to the log. The log is a separate chat window in which you can also enter console commands. It is only visible to the host. If a table is used for \"element\", the log will automatically display the key/value contents of it. log(element, label, tag) element : The information you want placed into the log. label : Text to be placed before the Var element is printed to the log. Optional, defaults to an empty String. Empty Strings are not displayed. tag : Name that is usable to categorize log entries. (See: logStyle ) Optional, defaults to an empty String. Empty Strings are not displayed. log ( getAllObjects (), \"All Objects:\" , \"table\" ) logStyle(...) Set style options for the specified tag type for the log. This can also be set in the system console with the \"log_style_tag\" command. logStyle(tag, tint, prefix, postfix) tag : A String of the log's tag. tint : RGB value to tint the log entry's text. String color will also work. Example: \"Red\" prefix : Text to place before this type of log entry. Optional, defaults to an empty String. Empty Strings are not displayed. postfix : Text to place after this type of log entry. Optional, defaults to an empty String. Empty Strings are not displayed. function onLoad () logStyle ( \"players\" , { 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 }, \"\" , \"End List\" ) log ( getSeatedPlayers (), \"players\" ) end print(...) Print a string into chat that only the host is able to see. Used for debugging scripts. print(message) message : Text to print into the chat log. printToAll(...) Print a message into the in-game chat of all connected players. printToAll(message, message_tint) message : Message to place into players' in-game chats. message_tint : RGB values for the text's color tint. printToAll ( \"Hello World!\" , { r = 1 , g = 0 , b = 0 }) printToColor(...) Print a message to the in-game chat of a specific player. printToColor(message, player_color , message_tint) message : Message to place into the player's in-game chat. player_color : Player Color of the player that will receive the message. message_tint : RGB values for the text's color tint. printToColor ( \"Hello Red.\" , \"Red\" , { r = 1 , g = 0 , b = 0 })","title":"Base"},{"location":"base/#function-summary","text":"","title":"Function Summary"},{"location":"base/#global-functions","text":"General functions which work within any script.

Lua: Added access to Components and Children of Unity objects. All details on this process are outlined on the new Component page. 2/05/19 - v11.1 Lua: Added group(table). This allows you to group a table of objects, in the same way the \"G\" key would for a player! It returns a list of the grouped objects. Added addDecal(table), getDecals(), and setDecals(table). Now scripting can add decals into the game world. Added object.getJoints(). When a table of parameters for a joint is returned, it now includes joint_object_guid. This is the GUID for the object which is attached by the joint. Added desired_position to the list of parameters returned by .getCustomObject() when it is used on a Jigsaw Puzzle piece. This parameter is the \"solved\" position for the piece. New Time class added, used to easily fetch information like os.time(), but also other informations like time passed since last frame, total frames passed, etc. pingTable(vector) added to the Player class. Now a script can emulate a player pinging. Added setComponentVar(componentName, varName, value) and getComponentVar(componentName, varName) as an object function. This allows you to access components that you have made part of your AssetBundle via scripting. For example, changing lights or colliders on the fly. These functions will also work on the components of default objects like \"Collider\" and \"Light\". 11/06/18 - v11.0 Lua: Fog of War API elements added object.getFogOfWarReveal() and object.setFogOfWarReveal(table) to access an Object's ability to reveal Fog of War. object.ignore_fog_of_war member variable added (prevents object from being hidden) Play Area Change player area with Physics.play_area API Improvements Knowledge Base link added to left nav bar. Minor visual improvements Footer returns 08/17/18 - v10.9 Lua: Updates to the new Wait class Added repetitions to Wait.time to better emulate Timer. Wait.time(func, time, number_repetitions). Using -1 will cause infinite repetitions Improvements to stop() so it should work more as expected. Returns from getObject and getStates improved to a common standard, includes: Name and Nickname Description Lua Script and Lua Script State New Object functions: obj.drop() causes the item, if held by a player, to be dropped. setHiddenFrom(players) Hides objects from a specific player/players. Uses \"hand zone\" hiding. setInvisibleTo(players) Hides objects from a specific player/players. Uses \"hidden zone\" hiding. attachHider(...) and attachInvisibleHider(...) are more advanced version of setHiddenFrom and setInvisibleTo, there to help handle complex situations easily. Old Object Functions (with new features!) setRotationValues() now allows you to start a name/value with a # and it won't display the value in the tooltip. randomize(color) Now an optional string can be added so that onObjectRandomized will trigger, indicating that player color triggered it. New base function: get/setVectorLines() Allows for lines to be placed via scripting using the new vector line tools` New Spawnable object: Custom Decks! Technically this was added before, but now it works and is documented! Spawn using spawnObject then set it using setCustomObject Clarifications to the Object class Some functions, let setSnapPoints or call, work on both Object and Global. To highlight which Object functions can be directed at the game world, they have been broken out on the Object page into a \"Global Functions\" section. New Object member Variables use_rotation_value_flip can be used to modify which direction objects flip. is_face_down determines if an object's \"face\" is pointed down (like with cards). The face is the direction that faces the positive Y value. hide_when_face_down hides an Object when it is face-down. Objects are hidden like if in a hidden zone. The face is the direction that faces the positive Y value. New Event onObjectEnterContainer has long been a requested event, and it is now available! 7/9/18 - v10.8 Lua: putObject() now returns an Object. Using it to combine two cards will return an object reference to the newly formed deck Using it to put an object into a container/stack/deck will return the container/stack/deck it was made part of New class: Notes Contains notebook and set/getNotes functions Devalued the old \"Base\" versions of these functions This means they are not in the documentation but will, for legacy reasons, still function. New class: Wait This new class allows you to easily trigger functions after some form of delay Contains frames, time, condition, and stop functions Devalued Timer class entirely This means Timer is removed from documentation but, for legacy reasons, still functions. New Object functions: obj.cut(int) - Cuts a deck at the given card index obj.split(int) - Splits a deck in a number of stacks obj.getRotationValue - Returns the current rotationValue of an object (see: gizmo tool) This function existed previously, but was not documented. New Event functions: onObjectPeeked(player, object) - Triggers when peek is used by a player onPeek(player) - Triggers when a specific object is peeked onRandomize(player) - Triggers when randomize (R) is used on an object. Player Color strings convert automatically Example: printToAll(\"Hello\", \"Green\") Snap points created on objects use Vectors local to the Object, rather than global This applies to both position and rotation Fix for optional parameters of spawnObjectJSON() New Object Member Variables loading_custom - Indicates if the assets of a custom element are being loaded. spawning - Indicates if any object is currently in the process of spawning. These are helpful to determine if elements are loaded into the game fully Especially useful with the new Wait class! Callback Changes Callback methods are being devalued (still work, but not documented) Being replaced with callback_function which directly triggers a function at the same time a callback would have been triggered. Done with takeObject, spawnObject(s) and webRequest(s). Custom UI: New Lua function: UI.setValue(string id, string value) - Updates the value that appears within element tags (ex: <Text>THIS</Text>) UI.getValue(string id) - Obtains the value that appears within element tags (ex: <Text>THIS</Text>) Both support Rich Text! New InputField attribute placeholder - Greyed out text that appears in the input if there is no text present. New Lua Function: get/setCustomAssets() - Allows you to obtain custom UI assets uploaded to the UI Assets window. Works on global or on object's assets. 6/18/18 - v10.7 Custom UI: Visibility attribute now supports admin, host, and team names. Clicking button won't block your hotkeys anymore. Added getXmlTable() setXmlTable(). Fixed onValueChanged recursive event loop. Fixed setAttribute() not working if it thought there wasn't a change. Fixed not being able to setXml() with an empty string. Fix support for RichText in Get/SetXmlTable(). Fixed zombie Xml UI when opening File Browser. Lua: Added Player.getAvailableColors() and Player.getColors(). Added SetSnapPoints() and GetSnapPoints(). Added JointTo(). Lots of scripting improvements to make it easier to convert between Lua Tables and C# types. Fixed Hotseat crash when using scripting input fields. Fixed camera triggering scripting zone. Fixed Turns.getNextColor() returning name instead of color. 5/30/18 - v10.6.1 Custom UI: Added getXmlTable() and setXmlTable() for dealing with Xml easier with Lua tables. Changed setXml() from changing the actual Xml for the save file so everything is runtime changes only. Changed getXml() to return the current Xml string including any runtime changes from setAttribute(). Fixed event recursion causing a potential lock up. Fixed setXml() not working with empty string. Lua: Added a 'debug_external_api' console command to show logging for external api messages. Fixed logging an empty table throwing null. 5/25/18 - v10.6 Custom UI: 3D UI added for objects (simialar to createButton/Input) Each object can have its own assets (images) Point scripting towards an object UI with object.UI.setAttribute(...) Events called from an object's UI will automatically go to that object's Script. To override that feature and send it to Global, use Global/functionName for the attribute's name. UI.getXml() and UI.setXml() added: Allows for dynamic UI creation from a string This OVERWRITES THE CURRENT XML on the target Global/object!!! Click sounds added for inputs Text universal attributes outlined in attributes section setLookingForPlayers() added. FIXED: Player colors now match TTS colors. For example, \"red\" is now equivalent to the player color red exactly. FIXED: Dragging is improved so the element doesn't snap to its rectAlignment when dragged. FIXED: When changing active attribute from script visibility would sometimes not work correctly 5/9/18 - v10.5.1 Custom UI: Added UI.show(id) and UI.hide(id) for disabling and enabling ui with animations. Now support the Image tag for custom images. Supports overriding the look of the UI using this custom image support. Fixed visibility attribute not working correctly on elements with no id attribute or layout tag. Fixed offsetXY set/getAttribute() not working. Added Tooltip attribute for all objects 5/7/18 - v10.5 Addition of XML Custom UI and associated documentation as part of this documentation. onSearchStart/onSearchEnd/onObjectSearchStart/onObjectSearchEnd added to Events. The log() command's \"label\" and \"tag\" parameters were reversed to log(object, label, tags) Scripted object button changes The click_function of scripted object buttons now passes an argument for alt_click. This allows determining if anything besides left click was used on the button (like right click) hover_color and press_color added as optional parameters getJSON() and spawnObjectJSON() created. Turns global static class added Member variables for controlling how turns work New event trigger for player turns beginning (onPlayerTurn) Devalued previous onPlayerTurn events Changelog moved under Getting Started due to the fact that it applies to the UI API as well as the scripting API.

They interact directly with the Unity properties of the objects that Tabletop Simulator is composed of. This means that a level of understanding of how Unity works is required to utilize these commands. Warning In other words, this is a highly advanced feature and this API is only able to teach you the basic commands to utilize it. General Concepts Every object in a \"room\" of Tabletop Simulator is a GameObject . Some sort of entity which exists within the scene. When a room is created, the GameObjects are loaded and initiated into the Lua script system. This is why, if you spawn a block and then run print(self) on it, it will print BlockSquare(Clone) (LuaGameObjectScript) into the chat. BlockSquare(Clone) is the GameObject, while (LuaGameObjectScript) is the Lua scripting system. GameObjects themselves contain many variables called Components . These can be the Collider, Transform, Mesh, etc that compose a GameObject, telling Unity how to render it. The component functions allow you to directly access the GameObjects and Components that make up any object in Tabletop Simulator, including your own AssetBundles. This means you can attach all manner of components (lights, sounds, and a lot more) and then control them. Finally, each Component has Vars , variables which you can modify to change how that Component effects the GameObject. The best way to explain this more clearly is with a few examples. General Examples The specific functions will be covered further down this page. These examples are scripts placed on a regular red block. Disable Receiving Shadows function onLoad () -- Get the MeshRenderer of the block's GameObject local blockComp = self . getComponent ( \"MeshRenderer\" ) -- Disable its ability to have a shadow cast onto it by another Object blockComp . set ( \"receiveShadows\" , false ) end Modify Object's Collider function onLoad () -- Get the BoxCollider Component of the block's GameObject local blockComp = self . getComponent ( \"BoxCollider\" ) -- Now lets make its collider disappear blockComp . set ( \"enabled\" , false ) -- Watch the block fall through the world and vanish -- The system deletes it once it falls too far end Completly Silence an Object function onLoad () -- Get the AudioSource Component of the block's GameObject local blockComp = self . getComponent ( \"AudioSource\" ) -- Mute it blockComp . set ( \"mute\" , true ) -- Now it makes no sound when impacting anything. end And these examples are only scraping the surface of what these functions can do. It essentially gives you near-full access to anything an object in Unity is capable of. Commands Object and GameObject Commands These can be used on either a regular in-game Object or an in-game Objects GameObject . Command Name Description Return getComponent( name) Obtains a component reference from an Object, by name. Component getComponents( optional_name) Returns all components on a game object. The name is an optional component name to narrow results with. Component in name Returns the name of the given Object or GameObject. GameObject Children Commands When you access an in-game Object normally with Lua, it is always the \"parent\" object. Other objects can be \"attached\" to that parent object as a child object. You are able to access those children with these commands. Command Name Description Return getComponentInChildren( name) Obtains a component reference from a child GameObject, by name. Component getComponentsInChildren( optional_name) Returns all components of all child GameObjects attached to this parent Object. The name is an optional component name to narrow results with. Component in getChild( name) Obtains a reference to the GameObject of a child object. The name is the name of the GameObject. GameObject getChildren() Returns a list of all GameObjects attached under the parent GameObject. GameObject in Component Commands These commands are used on the Components of objects to find or modify the values of their variables. The values will depend on which variable is being changed. They are usually System.Int32 (an Integer), System.Boolean (a Bool) or UnityEngine.Vector3 (a Vector). These are all used on Components.

Some sort of entity which exists within the scene. When a room is created, the GameObjects are loaded and initiated into the Lua script system. This is why, if you spawn a block and then run print(self) on it, it will print BlockSquare(Clone) (LuaGameObjectScript) into the chat. BlockSquare(Clone) is the GameObject, while (LuaGameObjectScript) is the Lua scripting system. GameObjects themselves contain many variables called Components . These can be the Collider, Transform, Mesh, etc that compose a GameObject, telling Unity how to render it. The component functions allow you to directly access the GameObjects and Components that make up any object in Tabletop Simulator, including your own AssetBundles. This means you can attach all manner of components (lights, sounds, and a lot more) and then control them. Finally, each Component has Vars , variables which you can modify to change how that Component effects the GameObject. The best way to explain this more clearly is with a few examples.","title":"General Concepts"},{"location":"component/#general-examples","text":"The specific functions will be covered further down this page.

This will work in both a Global script, and an Object script. It is used to allow information to persist through saving/loading, for example, to let your script remember its data previously after hitting the Undo or Redo button. By placing script information into a Lua table, then encoding that data into JSON , you are able to save information about the script's current state onto the script's parent, in the form of a string. You can also return a string value in this function to stash it. Important When using onSave() , information is saved into the save file you are using. Using Save & Apply does NOT cause it to record data, only overwriting your save will update what information onSave() is trying to record. Warning You can save almost any data in a table using this function, but Object references DO NOT persist. If you need to record an Object using onSave() , record its GUID instead. data_table = { answer = 42 } function onSave () saved_data = JSON . encode ( data_table ) return saved_data end Check the onLoad() section for how to load that stored JSON information into your script. onScriptingButtonDown(...) Called when a scripting button (numpad by default) is pressed.

Communication between the editor and TTS occurs via two localhost TCP connections: one where TTS listens for messages and one where the editor listens for messages. All communication messages are JSON. Atom as the Server The following are messages the editor plugin listens for and handles. Atom listens for incoming localhost TCP connections on port 39998. Pushing New Object When clicking on \"Scripting Editor\" in the right click contextual menu in TTS for an object that doesn't have a Lua Script yet, TTS will send a JSON message with an ID of 0 and data for the object. The Atom plugin will open a new tab for this Object. If TTS is unable to connect to an external editor, e.g. if Atom is not running, then TTS falls back to the in-game editor. { \"messageID\" : 0 , \"scriptStates\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Chess Pawn\" , \"guid\" : \"db3f06\" , \"script\" : \"\" } ] } Loading a New Game After loading a new game in TTS, TTS will send all the Lua scripts and UI XML from the new game to Atom. TTS sends a JSON message with an ID of 1 and an array of the Lua Scripts and UI XMLs. TTS also sends this message as a response to requests made by the editor, as described later under messages TTS listens for and handles. { \"messageID\" : 1 , \"scriptStates\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Global\" , \"guid\" : \"-1\" , \"script\" : \"...\" , \"ui\" : \"...\" }, { \"name\" : \"BlackJack Dealer's Deck\" , \"guid\" : \"a0b2d5\" , \"script\" : \"...\" }, ] } Note that this message contains all objects in the TTS session that have Lua scripts or UI XML data. Any object not mentioned by this message does not have a Lua script or UI XML in TTS. Print/Debug Messages TTS sends all print() messages to Atom to be displayed in Atom's console (ctrl + alt + i). TTS sends a JSON message with an ID of 2 and the message. { \"messageID\" : 2 , \"message\" : \"Hit player! White\" } Error Messages TTS sends all Lua error messages to Atom to be displayed in Atom's console (ctrl + alt + i) . TTS sends a JSON message with an ID of 3 and the error message. { \"messageID\" : 3 , \"error\" : \"chunk_0:(36,4-8): unexpected symbol near 'deck'\" , \"guid\" : \"-1\" , \"errorMessagePrefix\" : \"Error in Global Script: \" } Custom messages A messageID of 4 is used to send a custom message from TTS to the attached editor. This is done in Lua by calling sendExternalMessage with the table of data you wish to send. It is up to the editor how it uses this information (usually this message is used when the editor itself has sent code to be executed by TTS, which will send something back. i.e. this is mainly of use for people developing editor plugins). { \"messageID\" : 4 , \"customMessage\" : { \"foo\" : \"Hello\" , \"bar\" : \"World\" } } Return messages When the editor sends Lua code to TTS using the Execute Lua Code message (detailed below), if that code returns a value it will be sent back to the editor using message ID 5 . { \"messageID\" : 5 , \"returnValue\" : true } Game Saved Whenever the player saves the game in TTS, a save game notification is sent to any attached editor using message ID 6 . Object Created Whenever the player creates an object in TTS a notification is sent to any attached editor using message ID 7 . { \"messageID\" : 7 , \"guid\" : \"abcdef\" } Tabletop Simulator as the Server The following describes messages that TTS listens for and handles. TTS listens for incoming localhost TCP connections on port 39999. Get Lua Scripts TTS listens for a JSON message with an ID of 0, and responds by sending a JSON message containing scripts and UI XML. { \"messageID\" : 0 } The response is not sent over the same connection as the original request, but rather is sent to a server listening on the localhost on port 39998. The response is a message sent by TTS with an ID of 1, and is the same as the message TTS sends when loading a new game. Save & Play TTS listens for a JSON message with an ID of 1 containing an array of the Lua Scripts and UI XML. { \"messageID\" : 1 , \"scriptStates\" : [ { \"guid\" : \"-1\" , \"script\" : \"...\" , \"ui\" : \"...\" }, { \"guid\" : \"a0b2d5\" , \"script\" : \"...\" }, ] } TTS updates the Lua scripts and UI XML for any objects listed in the message, and then reloads the save file, the same way it does when pressing \"Save & Play\" within the in-game editor. Objects not mentioned in the scriptStates array are not updated. Any objects mentioned have both their Lua script and their UI XML updated. If no value is set for either the \"script\" or \"ui\" key then the corresponding Lua script or UI XML is deleted. That means if you want to update a Lua script for an object without changing its UI XML, then the message must contain both the updated Lua script and the unchanged UI XML. After TTS reloads the game, it then also sends a message with an ID of 1 back to the editor, with content the same as the message TTS sends when loading a new game. Custom Message TTS listens for a JSON message with an ID of 2 containing a custom message to be forwarded to the onExternalMessage event handler in the currently loaded game. { \"messageID\" : 2 , \"customMessage\" : { ... } } The value of customMessage must be a table, and is passed as a parameter to the event handler. If this value is not a table then the event is not triggered. Execute Lua Code TTS listens for a JSON message with an ID of 3 containing an object guid and lua script to run. { \"messageID\" : 3 , \"guid\" : \"-1\" , \"script\" : \"print(\\\"Hello, World\\\")\" } To execute Lua code for an object in the game that object must have an associated script in TTS. Otherwise the TTS scripting engine will fail with an error \"function \\<executeScript>: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\". Once the in-game editor shows a script associated with an object then TTS will be able to execute Lua code sent via JSON message for that object. { \"messageID\" : 3 , \"guid\" : \"e8e104\" , \"script\" : \"self.setPosition({0,10,0}\" }","title":"External Editor API"},{"location":"externaleditorapi/#atom-as-the-server","text":"The following are messages the editor plugin listens for and handles.

TTS Terms Object On in-game physical Object that currently exists in the scene. If an Object is placed inside of a bag/deck/etc, it stops existing and is no longer in the scene until it is pulled back out. Player A person in the game. Each Player is assigned a color, with spectators being \"Grey\". If you are attempting to identify a Player, you would use the color of the seat they are in to do so. Global Script The Global script, which is a script that is not attached to any particular Object. It is always present during a game. Object Script A script that is attached to an in-game Objecet, and is saved as part of it. This is similar to any other property like its scale or tint. Some functions ask for an Object reference in order to attempt to run a function on it. In these cases, Global (exactly as written here) is also a valid Object reference. GUID In Tabletop Simulator, a GUID is a unique 6-character string which can be used to identify in-game Objects . GUIDs are automatically assigned when objects exist within the scene. If an object is duplicated, it will sometimes have the same GUID for 1 frame before the engine assigns a new GUID to the newer Object. Objects in containers (bags/decks/etc) do not automatically get new GUIDs assigned to them in this way. Only once their contents are moved out into the scene. Custom Deck Card GUIDs When you first create a custom deck, all cards within the deck share the same GUID. If you need to reference individual GUIDs of cards, then the way to solve this is to lay out all cards from the deck at the same time to allow new GUIDs to be assigned by the game. This tool can be used to simplify the process. Classes Defining class requires further knowledge on object-oriented programming to really understand. However for the purposes of Tabletop Simulator Lua scripting, you can think of a class as a standard or collection that handles categories of objects. Object Classes Associated with in-game Objects.

Adds force to an object in a directional Vector. addForce(vector, force_type) Vector : A Vector of the direction and magnitude of force. force_type : An Int representing the force type to apply. Options below. Optional, defaults to 3. 1 : Continuous force, uses mass. (Force) 2 : Continuous acceleration, ignores mass. (Acceleration) 3 : Instant force impulse, uses mass. (Impulse) 4 : Instant velocity change, ignores mass. (Velocity Change) addTorque(...) Adds torque to an object in a rotational Vector. addTorque(vector, force_type) Vector : A Vector of the direction and magnitude of rotational force. Force Type : An Int representing the force type to apply. Options below. Optional, defaults to 3. 1 : Continuous force, uses mass. (Force) 2 : Continuous acceleration, ignores mass. (Acceleration) 3 : Instant force impulse, uses mass. (Impulse) 4 : Instant velocity change, ignores mass. (Velocity Change) getBounds() Returns a Table of Vector information describing the size of an object in Global terms. Bounds are part of Unity, and represent an imaginary square box that can be drawn around an object. Unlike scale, it can help indicate the size of an object in in-game units, not just relative model size. Return Table center : The Vector of the center of the bounding box. size : The Vector of the size of the bounding box. offset : The Vector of the offset of the center of the bounding box from the middle of the Object model. -- Example returned Table { center = { x = 0 , y = 3 , z = 0 , 0 , 3 , 0 }, size = { x = 5 , y = 5 , z = 5 }, 5 , 5 , 5 }, offset = { x = 0 , y =- 1 , z = 0 , 0 , - 1 , 0 } } getBoundsNormalized() Returns a Table of Vector information describing the size of an object in Global terms, as if it was rotated to {0,0,0}. Bounds are part of Unity, and represent an imaginary square box that can be drawn around an object. Unlike scale, it can help indicate the size of an object in in-game units, not just relative model size. Return Table center : The Vector of the center of the bounding box. size : The Vector of the size of the bounding box. offset : The Vector of the offset of the center of the bounding box from the middle of the Object model. -- Example returned Table { center = { x = 0 , y = 3 , z = 0 , 0 , 3 , 0 }, size = { x = 5 , y = 5 , z = 5 }, 5 , 5 , 5 }, offset = { x = 0 , y =- 1 , z = 0 , 0 , - 1 , 0 } } getScale() Returns a Vector of the current scale. Scale is not an absolute measurement, it is a multiple of the Object's default model size. So {x=2, y=2, z=2} would be a model twice its default size, not 2 units large. getTransformForward() Returns a Vector of the forward direction of this Object. The direction is relative to how the object is facing. -- Example of moving forward 5 units function onLoad () distance = 5 pos_target = self . getTransformForward () pos_current = self . getPosition () pos = { x = pos_current . x + pos_target . x * distance , y = pos_current . y + pos_target . y * distance , z = pos_current . z + pos_target . z * distance , } self . setPositionSmooth ( pos ) end getTransformRight() Returns a Vector of the forward direction of this object. The direction is relative to how the object is facing. -- Example of moving right 5 units function onLoad () distance = 5 pos_target = self . getTransformRight () pos_current = self . getPosition () pos = { x = pos_current . x + pos_target . x * distance , y = pos_current . y + pos_target . y * distance , z = pos_current . z + pos_target . z * distance , } self . setPositionSmooth ( pos ) end getTransformUp() Returns a Vector of the up direction of this Object. The direction is relative to how the object is facing. -- Example of moving up 5 units function onLoad () distance = 5 pos_target = self . getTransformUp () pos_current = self . getPosition () pos = { x = pos_current . x + pos_target . x * distance , y = pos_current . y + pos_target . y * distance , z = pos_current . z + pos_target . z * distance , } self . setPositionSmooth ( pos ) end positionToLocal(...) Returns a Vector after converting a world vector to a local Vector. A world Vector is a positional Vector using the world's coordinate system. A Local Vector is a positional Vector that is relative to the position of the given object. Object Scale This function takes the Object's scale into account, as the Object is the key relative point. positionToLocal(vector) vector : The world position to convert into a local position. positionToWorld(...) Returns a Vector after converting a local Vector to a world Vector. A world Vector is a positional Vector using the world's coordinate system. A Local Vector is a positional Vector that is relative to the position of the given object. Object Scale This function takes the Object's scale into account, as the Object is the key relative point. positionToLocal(vector) vector : The local position to convert into a world position. rotate(...) Rotates Object smoothly in the direction of the given Vector. This does not set the Object to face a specific rotation, it rotates the Object around by the number of degrees given for x/y/z. rotate(vector) vector : The amount of x/y/z to rotate by. --Rotates object 90 degrees around its Y axis self . rotate ({ x = 0 , y = 90 , z = 0 }) scale(...) Scales Object by a multiple. This does not set the Object to a specific scale, it scales the Object by the given multiple. scale(scale) scale : Multiplier for scale. {x=1, y=1, z=1} would not change the scale. scale(scale) scale : Multiplier for scale which is applied to the X/Y/Z. 1 would not change the scale. -- Both examples work to scale an object to be twice its current scale self . scale ({ x = 2 , y = 2 , z = 2 }) self . scale ( 2 ) setPositionSmooth(...) Moves the Object smoothly to the given Vector. setPositionSmooth(vector, collide, fast) Vector : A positional Vector. collide : If the Object will collide with other Objects while moving. fast : If the Object is moved quickly. setRotationSmooth(...) Rotates the Object smoothly to the given Vector. setRotationSmooth(vector, collide, fast) Vector : A rotational Vector. collide : If the Object will collide with other Objects while rotating. fast : If the Object is rotated quickly. UI Function Details createButton(...) Creates a scripted button attached to the Object. Scripted buttons are buttons that can be clicked while in-game that trigger a function in a script. Button Tips Buttons can not be clicked from their back side. Buttons can not be clicked if there is another object between the pointer and the button. This does not include the Object the button is attached to. Buttons are placed relative to the Object they are attached to. The maximum font size is capped at 1000. The minimum width/height is 60. Any lower number (besides 0) will appear to be 60. This prevents visual glitches involving the corner rounding. A button width/height of 0 will cause the button not to be drawn, but its label will be. This can be a way to attach text to an Object. You cannot assign an index to a button. It is given one automatically. createButton(parameters) parameters : A Table containing the information used to spawn the button. parameters.click_function : A String of the function's name that will be run when button is clicked. parameters.function_owner : The Object which contains the click_function function. Optional, Defaults to Global. parameters.label : Text that appears on the button. Optional, defaults to an empty string. parameters.position : Where the button appears, relative to the Object's center. Optional, defaults to {x=0, y=0, z=0}. parameters.rotation : How the button is rotated, relative to the Object's rotation. Optional, defaults to {x=0, y=0, z=0}. parameters.scale : Scale of the button, relative to the Object's scale. Optional, defaults to {x=1, y=1, z=1}. parameters.width : How wide the button will be, relative to the Object. Optional, defaults to 100. parameters.height : How tall the button will be, relative to the Object. Optional, defaults to 100. parameters.font_size : Size the label font will be, relative to the Object. Optional, defaults to 100. parameters.color : A Color for the clickable button. Optional, defaults to {r=1, g=1, b=1}. parameters.font_color : A Color for the label text. Optional, defaults to {r=0, g=0, b=0}. parameters.hover_color : A Color for the background during mouse-over. Optional. parameters.press_color : A Color for the background when clicked. Optional. parameters.tooltip : Popup of text, similar to how an Object's name is displayed on mouseover. Optional, defaults to an empty string. click_function(obj, player_clicker_color, alt_click) The click function which is activated by clicking this button has its own parameters it is passed automatically. obj : The Object the button is attached to. player_clicker_color : Player Color of the player that pressed the button. alt_click : True if a button other than left-click was used to click the button. function onLoad () params = { click_function = \"click_func\" , function_owner = self , label = \"Test\" , position = { 0 , 1 , 0 }, rotation = { 0 , 180 , 0 }, width = 800 , height = 400 , font_size = 340 , color = { 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 }, font_color = { 1 , 1 , 1 }, tooltip = \"This text appears on mouseover.\" , } self . createButton ( params ) end function click_func ( obj , color , alt_click ) print ( obj ) print ( color ) print ( alt_click ) end Bug Button scale currently distorts button height and width if the button is rotated at anything besides {0,0,0} . createInput(...) Creates a scripted input attached to the Object. Scripted inputs are boxes you can click inside of in-game to input/edit text. Every letter typed triggers the function. The bool that is returned as part of the input_function allows you to determine when a player has finished editing the input. Input Tips Inputs can not be clicked from their back side. Inputs can not be clicked if there is another object between the pointer and the inputs. This does not include the Object the input is attached to. Inputs are placed relative to the Object they are attached to. The maximum font size is capped at 1000. The minimum width/height is 60. Any lower number (besides 0) will appear to be 60. This prevents visual glitches involving the corner rounding. Font that does not fit in the input window's width/height does NOT display. To know how much height you need for each line, the formula is (font_size * # of lines) + 23 . In other words, multiply how many lines of text you want to display by your font_size and add 23. That is your height value. You cannot assign an index to an input. It is given one automatically. createInput(parameters) parameters : A Table containing the information used to spawn the input. parameters.input_function : A String of the function's name that will be run when a key is used or when it is deselected. parameters.function_owner : The Object which contains the input_function function.

The first input on any given Object has an index of 0, the next input on it has an index of 1, etc. Each Object has its own indexes. editInput(parameters) All fields besides index are optional. If not used, the element will default to the element's current setting. parameters : A Table containing the information used to spawn the input. parameters.index : Index of the input you want to edit. parameters.input_function : The function's name that will be run when the input is selected. parameters.function_owner : The Object which contains the input_function function. parameters.label : Text that appears as greyed out text when there is no value in the input. parameters.position : Where the input appears, relative to the Object's center. parameters.rotation : How the input is rotated, relative to the Object's rotation. parameters.scale : Scale of the input, relative to the Object's scale. parameters.width : How wide the input will be, relative to the Object. parameters.height : How tall the input will be, relative to the Object. parameters.font_size : Size the label/value font will be, relative to the Object. parameters.color : A Color for the input's background. parameters.font_color : A Color for the value text. parameters.tooltip : A popup of text, similar to how an Object's name is displayed on mouseover. parameters.alignment : How text is aligned in the input box. 1 : Automatic 2 : Left 3 : Center 4 : Right 5 : Justified parameters.value : A String of the text entered into the input. parameters.validation : An Int which determines what characters can be input into the value. 1 : None 2 : Integer 3 : Float 4 : Alphanumeric 5 : Username 6 : Name parameters.tab : An Int which determines how pressing tab is handled when inputting. 1 : None 2 : Select Next Input 3 : Indent self . editInput ({ index = 0 , value = \"New Value\" }) getButtons() Returns a Table of all buttons on this Object. The Table contains parameters tables with the same keys as seen in the createButton section, except each Table of parameters also contains an index entry. This is used to identify each button, used by editButton and removeButton . Indexes start at 0. getInputs() Returns a Table of all inputs on this Object. The Table contains parameters tables with the same keys as seen in the createInput section, except each Table of parameters also contains an index entry. This is used to identify each input, used by editInput and removeInput . Indexes start at 0. removeButton(...) Removes a specific button. Indexes start at 0. The first button on any given Object has an index of 0, the next button on it has an index of 1, etc. Each Object has its own indexes. Removing an index instantly causes all other higher indexes to shift down 1. removeButton(index) index : Button index to remove. removeInput(...) Removes a specific input. Indexes start at 0. The first input on any given Object has an index of 0, the next input on it has an index of 1, etc. Each Object has its own indexes. Removing an index instantly causes all other higher indexes to shift down 1. removeInput(index) index : Input index to remove. Get Function Details getCustomObject() Returns a Table with the Custom Object information of a Custom Object. See the Spawnable Objects page for the kind of information returned. -- Example returned Table for a custom token { image = \"SOME URL HERE\" , thickness = 0.2 , merge_distance = 15 , stackable = false , } Jigsaw Puzzles If you use getCustomObject() on a puzzle piece, it will also return desired_position , which is its position if the puzzle is \"solved\". You can use this to determine where to put the piece. getFogOfWarReveal() Settings impacting Fog of War being revealed. In the example returned table, these are the default values of any object. Color Selection \"Black\" and \"All\" are synonymous for Fog of War. Either means that all players can see the revealed area when reveal = true . -- Example returned Table for a custom token { reveal = false , color = 'All' , range = 5 } getJoints() Returns information on any joints attached to this object. This information included the GUID of the other objects attached via the joints. This function returns a table of sub-tables, each sub-table representing one joint. Example of a return table of an object with 2 joints: { { type = \"Spring\" , joint_object_guid = \"555555\" , collision = false , break_force = 1000 , break_torgue = 1000 , axis = { 0 , 0 , 0 }, anchor = { 0 , 0 , 0 }, connector_anchor = { 0 , 0 , 0 }, motor_force = 0 , motor_velocity = 0 , motor_free_spin = false , spring = 50 , damper = 0.1 max_distance = 10 min_distance = 0 }, { type = \"Spring\" , joint_object_guid = \"888888\" , collision = false , break_force = 1000 , break_torgue = 1000 , axis = { 0 , 0 , 0 }, anchor = { 0 , 0 , 0 }, connector_anchor = { 0 , 0 , 0 }, motor_force = 0 , motor_velocity = 0 , motor_free_spin = false , spring = 50 , damper = 0.1 max_distance = 10 min_distance = 0 }, } Example of printing the first sub-table's information: local jointsInfo = self . getJoints () for k , v in pairs ( jointsInfo [ 1 ]) do print ( k , \": \" , v ) end getObjects() Returns a Table of objects in the script zone/bag/deck. What it returns varies depending on the type of Object it is used on. If an Object is inside of a container, it does not exist in-game. As a result, you only get data on each Object, not an Object reference. Return Table by Object Type Scripting Zone Returns a Table of Object references to every object in the scripting zone. { object_1 , object_2 , } Bag or Deck Returns a Table of sub-Tables, each sub-Table containing data on 1 bagged item. Indexes start at 0. name : Name of the item. description : Description of the item. guid : GUID of the item. index : Index of the item, represents the item's order in the container. lua_script : Any Lua scripting saved on the item. lua_script_state : Any JSON save data on this item. nickname: A duplicate of the \"name\" field. This is for backwards compatibility purposes only. { { name = \"Object Name\" , description = \"Object Description\" , guid = \"AAA111\" , index = 0 , lua_script = \"Any Lua Script On This Object\" , lua_script_state = \"Any JSON Save Data On This Object\" }, } This function is often used with takeObject(...) to remove objects from containers. getRotationValue() Returns the current rotationValue. Rotation values are used to give value to different rotations (like dice) and are set using scripting or the Gizmo tool. The value returned is for the rotation that is closest to being pointed \"up\". The returned value will either be a number or a string, depending on the value that was given to that rotation. local value = self . getRotationValue () print ( value ) getRotationValues() Returns a Table of rotation values. Rotation values are used to give value to different rotations (like dice) based on which side is pointed \"up\". It works by checking all of the rotation values assigned to an object and determining which one of them is closest to pointing up, and then displaying the value associated with that rotation. You can manually assign rotation values to objects using the Rotation Value Gizmo tool (in the left side Gizmo menu) or using setRotationValues(...) . Return Table The returned Table contains sub-Tables, each sub-Table containing these 2 key/value pairs. value : What value is associated with a given rotation. Often a String or Int. Starting a value with a # will cause it not to show in the Object's tooltip. rotation : Rotation of the Object that best represents the given value pointing up. -- Example returned Table for a coin { { value = \"Heads\" , rotation = { x = 0 , y = 0 , z = 0 }}, { value = \"Tails\" , rotation = { x = 180 , y = 0 , z = 0 }}, } getStates() Returns a Table of information on the states of an Object. Stated Objects have ids (indexes) starting with 1. The returned table will NOT include data on the current state. Return Table Returns a table of sub-tables. Each sub-table represents one other state. name : Name of the item. description : Description of the item. guid : GUID of the item. id : Index of the item, represents the item's order in the states. lua_script : Any Lua scripting saved on the item. lua_script_state : Any JSON save data on this item. nickname: A duplicate of the \"name\" field. This is for backwards compatibility purposes only. -- Example returned Table { { name = \"First State\" , description = \"\" , guid = \"AAA111\" , id = 1 , lua_script = \"\" , lua_script_state = \"\" , }, { name = \"Second State\" , description = \"\" , guid = \"BBB222\" , id = 2 , lua_script = \"\" , lua_script_state = \"\" , }, } getValue() Gets a value. What the value represents depends on what type of Object this function is used on. Object Value Clock Returns Int of stopwatch/timer current time (in seconds) . Counter Returns Int of counter value. Rotation Value Returns Int of the face-up value. For objects with rotation values set using setRotationValues this is an index into the table of rotation values. Hidden Zone Returns String of the Player Color of the zone. Poker Chip Returns Int of the face value. Does not work on custom chips. Tablet Returns String of the current URL. Set Function Details setCustomObject(...) Sets a custom Object's properties. It can be used after spawnObject or on an already existing custom Object. If used on an already existing custom Object, you must use reload on the object after setCustomObject for the changes to be displayed. setCustomObject(parameters) The Table of parameters varies, depending on which type of custom Object it is. See the Spawnable Object page for the parameters needed. -- Example of a custom token params = { image = \"SOME URL HERE\" , thickness = 0.2 , merge_distance = 15 , stackable = false , } obj . setCustomObject ( params ) setFogOfWarReveal(...) Establish the settings and enable/disable an Object's revealing of Fog of War . setFogOfWarReveal(fog_setting) fog_setting : A Table containing information on if/how this Object should reveal Fog of War. reveal : Can the Object currently If this is not used, the current setting for this Object is kept. color : The rotation Vector of the Object that best represents the given value pointing up. If this is not used, the current setting for this Object is kept. \"Black\" means \"visible to all players.\" \"All\" means \"visible to all players.\" range : How far from the Object the reveal effect reaches (radius, inches). If this is not used, the current setting for this Object is kept. -- Example of enabling reveal for all players at 3 units of radius. params = { reveal = true , color = \"Black\" , range = 3 , } self . setFogOfWarReveal ( params ) setRotationValues(...) Sets rotation values of an object. Rotation values are used to give value to different rotations (like dice). It works by checking all of the rotation values assigned to an object and determining which one of them is closest to pointing up, and then displaying the value associated with that rotation. setRotationValues(rotation_values) rotation_values : A Table containing Tables with the following values. 1 sub-Table per \"face\". rotation_values.value : What value is associated with a given rotation. Often a String or Int. Starting a value with a # will cause it not to show in the Object's tooltip. rotation_values.rotation : The rotation Vector of the Object that best represents the given value pointing up. -- Example setting of rotation values for a coin rotation_values = { { value = \"Heads\" , rotation = { x = 0 , y = 0 , z = 0 }}, { value = \"Tails\" , rotation = { x = 180 , y = 0 , z = 0 }}, } self . setRotationValues ( rotation_values ) setValue(...) Sets a value on an Object. What the value represents depends on what type of Object it is. Object Value Clock Set Int for stopwatch/timer current time (in seconds) . Counter Set Int for counter value. Rotation Value Set Int for the face-up value. For objects with rotation values set with setRotationValues this is an index into the table of rotation values. Hidden Zone Set String for the Player Color of the zone. Tablet Set String for the current URL. Action Function Details clone(...) Copy/Paste this Object. clone(parameters) parameters : A Table with information used when pasting. parameters.position : Where the Object is placed. Optional, defaults to {x=0, y=3, z=0}. parameters.snap_to_grid : If the Object snaps to grid. Optional, defaults to false. cut(...) Cuts (splits) a deck down to a given card. In other words, it counts down from the top of the deck and makes a new deck of that size and puts the remaining cards in the other pile. After the cut, the resulting decks much each have at least 2 cards. This means the parameter used must be between 2 and totalNumberOfCards - 2 . Important New decks take a frame to be created. This means trying to act on them immediately will not work. Use a coroutine or timer to add a delay. cut(count) count : How many cards down to cut the deck. Optional, if no value is provided the deck is cut in half. Returned table The table that is returned 1 : The lower deck, containing the remaining cards in the deck. 2 : The upper deck, containing count number of cards. newDecks = deck . cut ( 5 ) --A delay would be required here for these next two lines to work. --The decks haven't been fully created yet. newDecks [ 1 ]. deal ( 1 ) newDecks [ 2 ]. deal ( 1 ) deal(...) Deals Objects to hand zones. Will deal from decks/bags/stacks as well as individual items. If dealing an individual item to a hand zone, it is a good idea to make sure that its Member Variable for use_hands is true . deal(number, player_color, index) number : How many to deal. player_color : The Player Color to deal to. Optional, defaults to an empty string. If not supplied, it will attempt to deal to all seated players. index : Index of hand zone to deal to. Optional, defaults to the first created hand zone. dealToColorWithOffset(...) Deals from a deck to a position relative to the hand zone. dealToColorWithOffset(offset, flip, player_color) offset : The x/y/z offset to deal to around the given hand zone. flip : If the card is flipped over when dealt. player_color : Hand zone Player Color to offset dealing to. -- Example of dealing 2 cards in front of the White player, face up. self . dealToColorWithOffset ({ - 2 , 0 , 5 }, true , \"White\" ) self . dealToColorWithOffset ({ 2 , 0 , 5 }, true , \"White\" ) jointTo(...) Joints objects together, in the same way the Joint tool does. Using obj.jointTo(), with no object or parameter used as arguments, will remove all joints from that Object. jointTo(object, parameters) object : The Object that the selected object will be jointed to. parameters : A table of parameters. Which parameters depends on the joint type. See below for more. All parameters have defaults, the same as the Joint Tool. Example of Fixed: self . jointTo ( obj , { [ \"type\" ] = \"Fixed\" , [ \"collision\" ] = true , [ \"break_force\" ] = 1000.0 , [ \"break_torgue\" ] = 1000.0 , }) Example of Spring: self . jointTo ( obj , { [ \"type\" ] = \"Spring\" , [ \"collision\" ] = false , [ \"break_force\" ] = 1000.0 , [ \"break_torgue\" ] = 1000.0 , [ \"spring\" ] = 50 , [ \"damper\" ] = 0.1 , [ \"max_distance\" ] = 10 , [ \"min_distance\" ] = 1 }) Example of Hinge: self . jointTo ( obj , { [ \"type\" ] = \"Hinge\" , [ \"collision\" ] = true , [ \"axis\" ] = { 1 , 1 , 1 }, [ \"anchor\" ] = { 1 , 1 , 1 }, [ \"break_force\" ] = 1000.0 , [ \"break_torgue\" ] = 1000.0 , [ \"motor_force\" ] = 100.0 , [ \"motor_velocity\" ] = 10.0 , [ \"motor_freeSpin\" ] = true }) putObject(...) Places an object into a container (chip stacks/bags/decks). If neither Object is a container, but they are able to be combined (like with 2 cards), then they form a deck/stack. putObject(put_object) put_object : An Object to place into the container. Returned Object The container is returned as the Object reference. Either this is the container/deck/stack the other Object was placed into, or the deck/stack that was formed by the putObject action. -- Example of a script on a bag that places Object into itself local obj = getObjectFromGUID ( \"AAA111\" ) self . putObject ( obj ) reload() Returns Object reference of itself after it respawns itself. This function causes the Object to be deleted and respawned instantly to refresh it, so its old Object reference will no longer be valid. Most often this is used after using setCustomObject(...) to modify a custom object. split(...) Splits a deck, as evenly as possible, into a number of piles. Important New decks take a frame to be created. This means trying to act on them immediately will not work. Use a coroutine or timer to add a delay. split(piles) piles : How many piles to split the deck into. Optional, if no value is provided, it is split into two piles. Minimum Value: 2 Maximum Value: Number-Of-Cards-In-Deck / 2 Returned table The number of Objects in the table is equal to the number of decks created by the split. They are ordered so any larger decks come first. The table that is returned 1 : The first deck created 2 : The second deck created 3 : The third deck created (etc) newDecks = deck . split ( 4 ) --A delay would be required here for these next four lines to work. --The decks haven't been fully created yet. newDecks [ 1 ]. deal ( 1 ) newDecks [ 2 ]. deal ( 1 ) newDecks [ 3 ]. deal ( 1 ) newDecks [ 4 ]. deal ( 1 ) takeObject(...) Takes an object from a container (bag/deck/chip stack) and places it in the world. Tip Spawned Objects take a moment to be physically spawned into the game. The purpose of the callback functionality is to allow you to run additional actions after the Object has been initiated fully into the instance. It is also possible to add a delay using a Wait function instead. takeObject(parameters) parameters : A Table of parameters used to determine how takeObject will act. parameters.position : A Vector of the position to place Object. Optional, defaults to container's position + 2 on the x axis. parameters.rotation : A Vector of the rotation of the Object. Optional, defaults to the container's rotation. parameters.flip : If the Object is flipped over. Optional, defaults to false. Only used with decks, not bags/stacks. If rotation is used, flip's Bool will be ignored. parameters.guid : GUID of the Object to take. Optional, no default. Only use index or guid, never both. parameters.index : Index of the Object to take. Optional, no default. Only use index or guid, never both. parameters.top : If an object is taken from the top (vs bottom). Optional, defaults to true. parameters.smooth : If the taken Object moves smoothly or instantly. Optional, defaults to true. parameters.callback_function : Function to activate once the taken Object fully \"exists\". Optional, defaults to not being used. A reference to the object spawned is always passed to callback_function. See the example for how to access it. function onLoad () futureName = \"Taken from container!\" takeParams = { position = { x = 0 , y = 3 , z = 5 }, callback_function = function ( obj ) take_callback ( obj , futureName ) end , } self . takeObject ( takeParams ) end function take_callback ( object_spawned , name ) object_spawned . setName ( name ) end Tip for using GUID to pull Object When getting the GUIDs of objects in a container, it is possible items can have the same GUID while in a container. This is because only once two items try to exist at the same time is one of them given a new GUID, and Objects in a container do not currently exist. Removing all Objects from the container at once will force all of them to be given unique GUIDs. Tip for using index to pull Object When you take an Object from the container, all higher indexes are reduced by 1 instantly. If you pull more than once Object at once by their index, you must account for this index changing. Hide Function Details setHiddenFrom(...) Hides the Object from the specified players, as if it were in a hand zone. Using an empty table will cause the Object to remove the hiding effect. setHiddenFrom(players) players : A table containing colors to hide the Object from. (color_name) : Strings of the color name of each player. function onLoad () self . setHiddenFrom ({ \"Blue\" , \"White\" }) end Tip Just like Objects in a hand zone, the player/s the object is hidden from can still interact/move the hidden Object. It still exists to them, but is shown as a question mark or as a hidden card. setInvisibleTo(...) Hides the Object from the specified players, as if it were in a hidden zone. Using an empty table will cause the Object to remove the hiding effect. setInvisibleTo(players) players : A table containing colors to hide the Object from. (color_name) : Strings of the color name of each player. function onLoad () self . setInvisibleTo ({ \"Blue\" , \"White\" }) end Tip Just like Objects in a hidden zone, the player/s the object is hidden from can still interact/move the hidden Object. It still exists to them, just invisibly so. attachHider(...) A more advanced version of setHiddenFrom(...) , this function is also used to hide objects as if they were in a hand zone. It allows you to identify multiple sources of \"hiding\" by an ID and toggle the effect on/off easily. This function is slightly more complicated to use for basic hiding, but allows for much easier hiding in complex situations. attachHider(id, hidden, players) id : The unique name for this hiding effect. Tip: You can use descriptive tag names like \"fog\" or \"blindness\" hidden : If the hiding effect is enabled or not. players : A table containing colors to hide the Object from. Optional, an empty table (or no table) hides for everyone. (color_name) : Strings of the color name of each player. function onLoad () --Enable hide self . attachHider ( \"hide\" , true , { \"Blue\" , \"White\" }) --Disable hide --self.attachHider(\"hide\", false, {\"Blue\", \"White\"}) end Tip Just like Objects in a hand zone, the player/s the object is hidden from can still interact/move the hidden Object. It still exists to them, but is shown as a question mark or as a hidden card. attachInvisibleHider(...) A more advanced version of setInvisibleTo(...) , this function is also used to hide objects as if they were in a hidden zone. It allows you to identify multiple sources of \"hiding\" by an ID and toggle the effect on/off easily. This function is slightly more complicated to use for basic hiding, but allows for much easier hiding in complex situations. attachInvisibleHider(id, hidden, players) id : The unique name for this hiding effect. Tip: You can use descriptive tag names like \"fog\" or \"blindness\" hidden : If the hiding effect is enabled or not. players : A table containing colors to hide the Object from.

You do not need to declare a type in Lua, but in this API you will see them indicated. This is only so you know what kind of information is required in a given variable/parameter. This API utilizes the following types. Common Standards Tag Type Description Example nil No value. nil int Non-decimal value. 5 float Non-exact decimal value. 2.032 bool true or false value. true string A series of characters. \"Hello.\" table A container with keys and values. {[ \"key\" ] = \"value\" , true , 5 } object An in-game physical Object. Sometimes Global. Global or self player An in-game Player. Player [ \"White\" ] variable A combination of other types. You will also see tags for Color, Vector, and Function. See below for more info. For more information on a type, you can read below or refer to the relevant Lua documentation . Special Standards Some types need to be used in specific ways. For Color and Vector, they are Tables that are used often in Tabletop Simulator. They represent Vectors and Colors, and their contents must be formatted a certain way to be utilized correctly. For Functions, they are used when a delay is required within a running script that have specific requirements. Color Color is a type of Table that is used to define RGB values for tinting. Keys The Table will contain the keys r , g , b , a and/or 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . The letter and numeric keys are duplicates of each other, and each represents a color or transparency. Color Letter Key Number Key red r 1 green g 2 blue b 3 alpha a 4 As an example, an Object with a white color tint would return this table: { r = 1 , g = 1 , b = 1 , 1 = 1 , 2 = 1 , 3 = 1 , } Notice it does not contain the a or 4 keys. This is because currently only scripted buttons and scripted inputs utilize the alpha channel (transparency). Mixed Keys Only one type of key, number or letter, is required. If both a are present in a Table, the numeric key is ignored and only the letter key is used. --Valid Table for red { r = 1 , g = 0 , b = 0 } --Valid Table for blue { 0 , 0 , 1 } --This Table would be red. { r = 1 , g = 0 , b = 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 } Value Values are between 0 and 1 for each key. If you are using RGB color that is in 0-255, you can use simple math to convert to the proper value. --To display a color that is r=50, b=83, g=199 self . setColorTint ({ 50 / 255 , 83 / 255 , 199 / 255 }) Strings You are also able to use a String in place of a color table. Using a Player Color will automatically fill in that value. It works with any of the 12 color names, as they are written on the Player Color page. Example: printToAll(\"Test\", \"Green\") Vector Vector is a type of Table that is used to define a position, rotation or direction. Keys The Table will contain the keys x , y , z and/or 1 , 2 , 3 . The letter and numeric keys are duplicates of each other. Letter Key Number Key x 1 y 2 z 3 As an example, An Object at coordinate X=5, Y=2, Z=-1 would return this table: { x = 5 , y = 2 , z =- 1 , 1 = 5 , 2 = 2 , 3 =- 1 , } Mixed Keys Only one type of key, number or letter, is required. If both a are present in a Table, the numeric key is ignored and only the letter key is used. --Valid Table for 1 to the right { x = 1 , y = 0 , z = 0 } --Valid Table for 1 unit forward { 0 , 0 , 1 } --This Table would be for 1 unit to the right. { x = 1 , y = 0 , z = 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 } Value Range The range of values depend on the type of Vector you are using. Type Description Range Position A point in space. Any number within the bounds of the world. Rotation Angle, in degrees. -180 to 180. Direction Vector direction. -1 to 1. Type Details Position X is right/left, Y is up/down, Z is forward/back. A positional Vector can be either world or local. Most of Tabletop Simulator's functions use world positional Vectors. Type Description World The center of the instance is {x=0, y=0, z=0} . That is usually near the tabletop's center. Local The center of the Object's model is {x=0, y=0, z=0} . The center of an Object is determined by the model's creator. Conversion Between World/Local positionToWorld(...) and positionToLocal(...) can be used to convert between the two types. Rotation X is pitch (nodding your head), Y is yaw (shaking you head), Z is roll (tilting your head). Direction X is right/left, Y is up/down, Z is forward/back. Function A function is a section of code that can be run when triggered. In Lua, you are able to pass (use as a parameter) functions. Some elements in Tabletop Simulator can be passed functions to perform some action with, like triggering it after a delay. Usage To pass a function, first you must create the function. There are multiple ways to do this: --Create it on-the-fly function () print ( \"Like This\" ) end --Create it with a variable name anyFuncName = function () print ( \"Like This\" ) end --Create it with a variable name that can also be passed parameters function anyFuncName ( printString ) print ( printString ) end Warning You need to pass a function, not a result of a function. So this will not work: Wait . frames ( print ( \"Ding\" ), 80 ) Instead, make the print the result of a function running: Wait . frames ( function () print ( \"Ding\" ) end , 80 ) Example As an example, here is Wait.frames(...) used 3 times. It waits a set number of frames and then activates a given function: function onLoad () --Built-in functions with parameters can be called directly --This is done by wrapping the function within `function()` and `end` Wait . frames ( function () print ( \"One\" ) end , 60 ) --You can also call custom functions you have made yourself --Pass them any parameters you wish Wait . frames ( function () sayTwo ( \"Two\" ) end , 120 ) --If you aren't passing any parameters to the function, you can shorten it Wait . frames ( sayThree , 180 ) end --Has its parameter passed to it function sayTwo ( s ) print ( s ) end --Does not have any parameters passed to it function sayThree () print ( \"Three\" ) end Lambda-Style Expressions You are able to replace function() and end with || , allowing for much shorter functions. Important Tips You create a | , on a standard keyboard, by holding shift and pressing the key above enter (backslash). || only work for one line. So if you intend to use a multi-line function, lambda-style will not be an option. When using || for a conditional function with Wait.condition(returnFunc, conditionalFunc) , you do not need to include return. If a parameter is passed to the return function, like with callback_function from spawnObject(...) , you can put a variable between the || characters to represent it. See the next section for an example. Lambda-Style Example Without Lambda-style: function onLoad () --Spawn a deck with a callback function that triggers once deck spawns --Also, pass a reference to the spawned object spawnObject ({ type = \"Deck\" , callback_function = function ( obj ) printCardCount ( obj ) end }) --Print after 1 second Wait . time ( function () print ( \"One Second\" ) end , 1 ) --Trigger a function after 2 seconds and send a parameter Wait . time ( function () printString ( \"Two Seconds\" ) end , 2 ) end function printCardCount ( deck ) cardList = deck . getObjects () print ( # cardList .. \" cards.\" ) end function printString ( s ) print ( s ) end With Lambda-style: function onLoad () --Spawn a deck with a callback function that triggers once deck spawns --Also, pass a reference to the spawned object spawnObject ({ type = \"Deck\" , callback_function = | obj | printCardCount ( obj ) }) --Print after 1 second Wait . time ( || print ( \"One Second\" ), 1 ) --Trigger a function after 2 seconds and send a parameter Wait . time ( || printString ( \"Two Seconds\" ), 2 ) end function printCardCount ( deck ) cardList = deck . getObjects () print ( # cardList .. \" cards.\" ) end function printString ( s ) print ( s ) end","title":"Types"},{"location":"types/#common-standards","text":"Tag Type Description Example nil No value. nil int Non-decimal value. 5 float Non-exact decimal value. 2.032 bool true or false value. true string A series of characters. \"Hello.\" table A container with keys and values. {[ \"key\" ] = \"value\" , true , 5 } object An in-game physical Object.

It is the method to interact with custom UI elements. It allows you to read/write attributes of elements defined in the XML of the UI. It also allows you to receive information from various inputs (like buttons) on-screen and on objects. Attention This class allows for the manipulation of UI at runtime . It does NOT modify or fetch the original XML in the editor, but rather what is displayed as it continues to run during a game. Just like with Lua, you can only get/set dynamic values during runtime. You can use onSave and onLoad to record any data you want to persist through save/load/undo. For more information on how to build UI elements within XML, view the UI API . Global and Object UI can either be placed on the screen by using the Global UI or placed on an Object using Object UI . Depending on which you are using, these commands are used differently. Example of calling a function targeted at the Global UI: UI.getAttributes(id) Example of calling a function targeted at an Object UI: object.UI.getAttributes(id) Inputs Input Elements are able to trigger a function. By default, Global UI will trigger a function in Global and Object UI will trigger a function in the Object's script. To change the target script for an input, view more details here . When creating the input element in XML, you will select the name of the function it activates. Regardless of its name, it always will pass parameters functionName(player, value, id) player : A direct Player reference to the person that triggered the input. value : The value sent by the input.

For more details, you can check out the Function section of the Introduction page. Function Summary Function Name Description Return condition( toRunFunc, conditionFunc, timeout, timeoutFunc) Activates a function when a given function returns true or activates a different function if a timeout occurs. frames( toRunFunc, frameCount) Activates a function after a set number of frames. stop( id) Stops a currently running Wait function. time( toRunFunc, time, repetitions) Activates a function after a set amount of time has passed. Function Details condition(...) Activates a function when a given function returns true or activates a different function if a timeout occurs. The returned value is an ID which can be used with stop to cancel the function at any time. condition(toRunFunc, conditionFunc, timeout, timeoutFunc) toRunFunc : The function to activate once the condition is met. conditionFunc : The function that is watched until it returns true . timeout : The amount of time, in seconds, before this function gives up checking the condition function.

Attribute types For XML, most of the attribute types are self-explanatory, like string or float (See Lua Scripting section for details on those). However XML has some unique types. HTML 6 Char Hex : #FFFFFF (white 100% opacity) 8 Char Hex : #FFFFFFCC (white 80% opacity) RGB Color : rgb(1,1,1) (white 100% opacity) RGBA Color : rgba(1,1,1,0.8) (white 80% opacity) Player Color : White (white 100% opacity) Color block values are used to specify the colors for elements such as buttons and input fields. Format: (normalColor|highlightedColor|pressedColor|disabledColor) where each color is formatted as above, e.g. #FFFFFF|White|#C8C8C8|rgba(0.78,0.78,0.78,0.5) True : 1 or true False : 0 or false Common Attributes Elements all share some common attributes which are not repeated under their separate entries. They can be broker down into category. General Attributes Attribute Name Description Type / Options Default Value active Specifies whether or not this element is active. This can be used to hide/show elements via scripting. Triggering this via script will not trigger animations. bool true class This allows you to group elements together by giving them the same class. It is used with Defaults . string (none) id Used by Lua scripting to identify an element within the XML. string (none) isDropReceiver Determine if an object triggers onElementDropped. bool false visibility What colors are able to see the element. See below for additional details. string (visible to all) Visibility Targets The visibility attribute allows for only certain people or groups to see an element. Hiding an element will hide its children as well. Visible To All Players Not using the visibility attribute (or setting it to an empty string) does not limit the visibility of the element. Visiblity Selection Host : Only visible to the game host. Admin : Only visible to the host and any promoted player. Red : Only visible to the player in that seat color. (Works with all valid color names ) Clubs : Only visible to members of that player group. (Works with all valid team names ) Combining Groups You are able to list multiple color names in a single string by placing a vertical line | between valid entries. Example: \"Red|Blue|Host\" would be visible to the red seat, blue seat and the host of the server. Text Attributes Many, but not all, elements have a text attribute.

Primarily this will be used to set styles and the like, but there is no restriction on what default values you can set. Defaults can be applied to all instances of a particular tag type, or only those of a particular class (as set by the class attribute). Please note that elements may use more than one class (separated by spaces). As with its HTML counterpart (CSS), XmlLayout Defaults are applied in a cascading fashion. This means that an element will always use the most recent value for an attribute - for example, if an element implements a class, it will use the attribute values defined by that class except when the element itself also defines those attributes (attributes defined on the element will always take precedence). Defaults tags can be placed anywhere in the Xml document, but will only apply to elements after it. Example: <Defaults> <!-- Set the default color and font size for all Text elements --> <Text color= \"#DDDDDD\" fontSize= \"16\" /> <!-- Set the default color for all Text elements using the 'darker' class --> <Text class= \"darker\" color= \"#AAAAAA\" /> </Defaults> <!-- This text's color will be \"#DDDDDD\" and its font size will be \"16\" --> <Text> Text </Text> <!-- This text's color will be \"#AAAAAA\" and its font size will be \"16\" --> <Text class= \"darker\" > Text </Text> <!-- Set the default border and text color for all tooltips --> <Tooltip tooltipBorderColor= \"rgb(1,1,1)\" tooltipTextColor= \"rgb(1,1,1)\" />","title":"Defaults"},{"location":"ui/inputelements/","text":"All input elements allow for the XML UI to interact with the Lua scripts in the game instance. Tip Be sure to check out the UI section of the Lua Scripting API for how to receive the input from these element types. With Lua scripting, you can even modify the UI elements! Targeting Triggers When using an attribute that triggers scripting, like onValueChanged or onClick, the UI will target a default location. Global UI targets Global script, Object UI targets the Object's script. This behavior can be overwritten. For example: <Button onClick= \"uiClickFunc\" > Click Me </Button> If this was in the Global UI, this would trigger a function in the Global Lua script function uiClickFunc () . But if you want to target a function on an Object's script? Place the GUID for the object before the function name, like so: <Button onClick= \"aaa111/uiClickFunc\" > Click Me </Button> Now when the button is clicked, it will still try to activate function uiClickFunc () but it will try to do so on the Object Lua script of the Object with the GUID of \"aaa111\". <Button onClick= \"Global/uiClickFunc\" > Click Me </Button> And if this was in an Object's UI, it would direct the function activation to Global instead of that Object. Remember you can also use the Id attribute to identify which UI element triggered the function.

The UI system is unique because the elements are created using a simple XML system. These UI elements can be created on screen using a Global UI or on individual in-game Objects. Core Features There are 3 main pieces to the UI system. Create Elements You are able to create individual elements and position them on the screen/object in a variety of ways. Import Assets By clicking the button in the upper-right corner of the scripting window in-game, you open a menu that lets you upload/manage assets that can be utilized by the UI. When you save your table after uploading images here, they are saved forever. Communicate with Lua Your scripts can be triggered by UI elements and your Lua scripts can also modify elements in the UI during gameplay. Getting Started Once you load a saved table, click the Scripting button at the top of the screen. The traditional scripting window will now be visible, but you will also see a button labeled UI . Using this button, you can toggle back and forth between Lua scripting and UI XML. In this UI window you will input your XML. Once you are finished, click Save & Play in its upper-left hand corner and the save file will re-load with your changes applied to it. If you do not see your UI elements appearing, it is possible your code has an error in it. Look down to the In-Game chat box for the error message It will indicate the line and character position the issue was discovered when trying to parse your code. Basics of XML In the UI XML, you create elements and modify them with attributes . Each element is created using tags. Here is an element being created. <Text> Displayed Text </Text> Those elements can be modified with attributes to change how they look and, in some cases, function. <Text fontSize= \"200\" > Bigger Displayed Text </Text> Input types are able to communicate to a Lua script in-game. <Button onClick= \"uibutton\" > Example Button </Button> There are even organizational methods you can do to easily group these elements together.
