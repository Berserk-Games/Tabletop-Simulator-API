The in-game editor will continue to exist for quick access to scripts, but development on it will cease to continue.\n\n\nPrefer another text editor? Take look at our \nExternal Editor API\n to make your own plugin.\n\n\nFeatures\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis is only a summarized list of features Atom offers. Check out a more complete documentation on the plugin specifically in the \nplugin wiki\n.\n\n\nSyntax Highlighting\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll standard Lua syntax is highlighted in multiple colors to help with readability.\n\n\n\n\nCode Autocompletion\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe entire Tabletop Simulator Lua Scripting API (with the exception of the Player class) has been added to the native Atom autocomplete system. Easily see all of the member variables and functions available to you with their parameters, return type, short description, and a link directly to our Knowledge Base with more information for that variable or function. Functions belonging to the Lua standard library classes such as math, coroutine, or os link directly to the official Lua documentation.\n\n\n\n\nTabletop Simulator Interactivity\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Atom plugin can directly connect to a running instance of Tabletop Simulator to get all of the existing Lua scripts on Objects and to call Save & Play. Both functions can be called directly from the Packages menu or the right click contextual menu. TTS must be running with the game loaded for these functions to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nAction Taken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Lua Scripts\n\n\nDownloads all existing scripts in a loaded Tabletop Simulator game with Atom. You will need to call Get Lua Scripts every time you change to a different game in TTS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave & Play\n\n\nSaves all Lua files in Atom, uploads them to a loaded Tabletop Simulator game, and reloads the current game (same as Save & Play in the in-game editor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time you start up Atom, the cached local *.lua files are deleted.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Atom\n\u00b6\n\n\nDownload and install Atom \nfrom the official website\n.\n\n\nInstalling the Official Plugin\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nClick on File -> Settings\n\n\nSelect the Install tab in Settings\n\n\nType in tabletopsimulator-lua into the search field and press the Enter key or click the Packages button\n\n\nClick the blue Install button for the tabletopsimulator-lua package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up Atom\n\u00b6\n\n\nTab Width\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy default, Tabletop Simulator scripts use a tab width of four spaces.

To optionally make Atom default to a tab width of four spaces:\n\n\n\n\nClick on File -> Settings\n\n\nSelect the Settings tab in Settings\n\n\nScroll down to Tab Length\n\n\nSet the Tab Length to 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTabls as Pipe Operators\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo enable tabs showing up as pipe operators \"|\" as an indent guide:\n\n\n\n\nClick on File -> Settings\n\n\nSelect the Settings tab in Settings\n\n\nScroll down to Show Indent Guide\n\n\nCheck Show Indent Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Atom Plugin\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe plugin will automatically check for updates when Atom is started. If a new update is found, it will update itself. You will have to manually restart Atom for the new version of the plugin to be loaded. You can check Atom's console if it found an update (ctrl + alt + i).\n\n\nAtom Tips\n\u00b6\n\n\nThese are just a few basic tips to help get the most out of Atom.\n\n\n\n\nPrint Messages\n\n\nAll print() functions automatically send their messages to Atom's console (ctrl + alt + i).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Messages\n\n\nAll Lua errors are automatically sent to Atom's console (ctrl + alt + i).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Save + Play\n\n\nHitting Ctrl + Shift + S will trigger Save & Play.",

It always starts with high-level summary information first and, if needed, detailed information towards the bottom.

The relevant files you can modify, as well as some detailed editing instructions, are listed on GitHub. You can make a pull request to made modifications/improvements that can be incorporated into this documentation.\n\n\nJust click the link in the pencil icon in the top-right of an article, or visit the GitHub page for more information by clicking GitHub Source in the far upper right.\n\n\n\n\nTTS Terms\n\u00b6\n\n\nObject\n\u00b6\n\n\nOn in-game physical Object that currently exists in the scene. If an Object is placed inside of a bag/deck/etc, it stops existing and is no longer in the scene until it is pulled back out.\n\n\nPlayer\n\u00b6\n\n\nA person in the game. Each Player is assigned a color, with spectators being \"Grey\". If you are attempting to identify a Player, you would use the color of the seat they are in to do so.\n\n\nGlobal Script\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Global script, which is a script that is not attached to any particular Object. It is always present during a game.\n\n\nObject Script\n\u00b6\n\n\nA script that is attached to an in-game Objecet, and is saved as part of it. This is similar to any other property like its scale or tint. Some functions ask for an Object reference in order to attempt to run a function on it. In these cases, Global (exactly as written here) is also a valid Object reference.\n\n\nGUID\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn Tabletop Simulator, a GUID is a unique 6-character \nstring\n which can be used to identify in-game \nObjects\n. GUIDs are automatically assigned when objects exist within the scene.\n\n\nIf an object is duplicated, it will sometimes have the same GUID for 1 frame before the engine assigns a new GUID to the newer Object. Objects in containers (bags/decks/etc) do not automatically get new GUIDs assigned to them in this way. Only once their contents are moved out into the scene.\n\n\nCustom Deck Card GUIDs\nWhen you first create a custom deck, all cards within the deck share the same GUID.

They represent Vectors and Colors, and their contents must be formatted a certain way to be utilized correctly.\n\n\nColor\n\u00b6\n\n\nColor is a type of Table that is used to define RGB values for tinting.\n\n\nKeys\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Table will contain the keys \nr\n, \ng\n, \nb\n, \na\n and/or \n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n. The letter and numeric keys are duplicates of each other, and each represents a color or transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor\n\n\nLetter Key\n\n\nNumber Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nred\n\n\nr\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngreen\n\n\ng\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblue\n\n\nb\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalpha\n\n\na\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, an Object with a white color tint would return this table:\n\n{\n\n    \nr\n=\n1\n,\n \ng\n=\n1\n,\n \nb\n=\n1\n,\n\n    \n1\n=\n1\n,\n \n2\n=\n1\n,\n \n3\n=\n1\n,\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nNotice it does not contain the \na\n or \n4\n keys. This is because currently only scripted buttons and scripted inputs utilize the alpha channel (transparency).\n\n\nMixed Keys\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnly one type of key, number or letter, is required. If both a are present in a Table, the numeric key is ignored and only the \nletter key\n is used.\n\n\n--Valid Table for red\n\n\n{\nr\n=\n1\n,\n \ng\n=\n0\n,\n \nb\n=\n0\n}\n\n\n--Valid Table for blue\n\n\n{\n0\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n1\n}\n\n\n--This Table would be red.\n\n\n{\nr\n=\n1\n,\n \ng\n=\n0\n,\n \nb\n=\n0\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n1\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\n\u00b6\n\n\nValues are between 0 and 1 for each key.

This is because only once two items try to exist at the same time is one of them given a new GUID, and Objects in a container do not currently exist. Removing all Objects from the container at once will force all of them to be given unique GUIDs.\nTip for using index to pull Object\nWhen you take an Object from the container, all higher indexes are reduced by 1 instantly. If you pull more than once Object at once by their index, you must account for this index changing.",

This is because only once two items try to exist at the same time is one of them given a new GUID, and Objects in a container do not currently exist. Removing all Objects from the container at once will force all of them to be given unique GUIDs. Tip for using index to pull Object When you take an Object from the container, all higher indexes are reduced by 1 instantly. If you pull more than once Object at once by their index, you must account for this index changing.",
